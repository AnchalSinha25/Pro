Microsoft Azure includes many services that can be used to implement and manage data engineering workloads.

The diagram displays the flow from left to right of a typical enterprise data analytics solution, including some of the key Azure services that may be used. Operational data is generated by applications and devices and stored in Azure data storage services such as Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, and Microsoft Dataverse. Streaming data is captured in event broker services such as Azure Event Hubs.

This operational data must be captured, ingested, and consolidated into analytical stores; from where it can be modeled and visualized in reports and dashboards. These tasks represent the core area of responsibility for the data engineer. The core Azure technologies used to implement data engineering workloads include:

Azure Synapse Analytics
Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
Azure Stream Analytics
Azure Data Factory
Azure Databricks
The analytical data stores that are populated with data produced by data engineering workloads support data modeling and visualization for reporting and analysis, often using sophisticated visualization tools such as Microsoft Power BI.

Data science and machine learning

Data science involves the statistical analysis of large volumes of data, often using tools such as Apache Spark and scripting languages such as Python. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 provides a highly scalable cloud-based data store for the volumes of data required in data science workloads.

Machine learning is a subarea of data science that deals with training predictive models. Model training requires huge amounts of data, and the ability to process that data efficiently. Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service in which data scientists can run Python code in notebooks using dynamically allocated distributed compute resources. The compute processes data in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 containers to train models, which can then be deployed as production web services to support predictive analytical workloads.
